        Please note that the value for confidence and numCount were swapped for this section.
        I correctly fixed the text accordingly onwards.
        <h2>section 4</h2>
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img1.png" width = "100%">
        Since I had three classes with one image of myself from distance, and another very close shot, 
        when I placed my face in front of the camera at a distance in between, the confidence and top K
        values were mixed between the first class and the third, which was expected.
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img2.png" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img3.png" width = "100%">
        The images above show how the two values (confidence and the top K values) change according to
        the distance of my face from the camera. They were pretty accurate. 
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img4.png" width = "100%">
        This screenshot shows when the two people are both in the camera that were classified as two different
        classes. The notified values show an accurate representation of the ratio of one person to another's 
        presence in the photo. 
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img5.png" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec4img6.png" width = "100%">
        These two photos show how it correctly classifies the person from the second class when she is at an 
        expected distance, but when she puts her face very close to the camera, which is what the first person 
        did to classify for class 3, the system classifed the image as class 3 (the class of a different person with 
        her face very close to the camera).
      </div>
      <div class = "container" id = "section5">
        <h3>section 5</h3>
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec5img1.png" width = "100%">
        This is the code that was modified. We decided to get the maximum top K value from the 3 that were classified,
        and then neglect the others if they are less than half the value of the maximum top K value. Then, we calculated
        the probability accordingly. This allowed for a better representation of what class was the most accurate, cnaceling
        the possible noise. 
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec5img5.png" width = "100%">
        This image shows a bit of a fault with this modification because since the image is more dominantly classified
        as the second class, the confidence level is 1 for the second class, with the other two neglected. However,
        the person from the different class was in the image, and the provided confidence level neglects this. 
        It treated the value as noise, but would have been a valuable information.

        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec6img1.png" width = "100%">
        As expected, when the number of samples were too little, such as 10, the classification was very inaccurate 
        when the previous tries in the eariler sections confused the system. A bit of a surprise was that too many samples
        didn't perfectly mean more accurate classification, because when the classifying person (not a still image) kept
        moving, the classifcation was harder with more varying samples. Still images were easy to classify with much less
        samples and keeping the number count made it simple, but otherwise, it was necessary to find out what the 
        best number of samples would be for classification. 
      </div>
      <div class = "container" id = "section7">
        <h3>section 7</h3>
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec7img1.png" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment1/sec7img2.png" width = "100%">
        Using the starter questions, we decided to play with having one less class and one more class.
        The results were interesting since the system had either one less class to compare the shown image to or one more 
        class to compare the image to. When the number of classes decreased, the confidence and the top K values were less
        divided, making the confidence level higher for each class when the system classified the image from one to another. 
        In contrast, when having more classes, the confidence level was divided among the classes, making the confidence value
        more spread out among the classes. As mentioned before in the previous sections, this again delt with how to classify
        some value as either noise or value information to return to the user. By experimenting with the number of classes, I think that
        having more classes and neglecting the top K values when it is significantly less than the maximum of the classes would balance
        out the values and help define the borderline of treating some values as noise or important. 
        I worked on this assignment with my partner, Ashley Lee.

      <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
      <div class = "container" id = "section1">
        <h3>section 1</h3>
        The model was invalid because the input image is 28 x 28 pixels, which was set as the input for the Softmax layer, 
        which takes 10 values (one for each digit) as input. So in order for this model to be valid, the inputs and outputs have
        to match between each layer, which is why we need two layers that first make the input from the image into a 1D vector, and then
        into 10 values for the Softmax layer. <br/>
        <h4>problem 1</h4>
        The reason why the classifications are almost always wrong is because the weights are set to random values and the values will 
        change as the network is trained. Currently, the network is not trained, so the classifications are incorrect. 
        I expect this particular network to be wrong with high probability. This is what is shown as results with the numbers very rarely 
        being classified as the actual value. The highest percentage I can see being correctly classified was an accuracy of around 40%.
      </div>
      <div class = "container" id = "section2">
        <h3>section 2: problem 2</h3>
        1. I observe all accuracies, but after training, the classification is significantly better, with a lot of the images being classified as
        the correct number with much higher probability of around 70-100%. However, there are still some errors where a number 8 was classfied 
        correctly with an accuracy of 20% and 60% as the number 0. The demo performs around 630 inferences / second. It trained 1980 examples per second. 
        <br/>
        Then with the Fashion MNIST, I observe similar pattern with the numbers, but when the difference is when the classification is correct, it is 
        mostly with a very high probability like 90-99%, but when it is incorrect, the accuracy was as low as 10%. The classification was harder when 
        the image was very similar to a different category such as a shirt vs. a pullover. The demo performed around 610 inferences / second. It trained 1980 examples per second.
        <br/>
        2. Even after training for a minute and half (total of 37824 examples), the accuracy is overall very low with plenty with no correct classification
        listed with probabilities (so, correction of 0 percent). Mostly the accuracy lies around an average of 30%, with plenty 0%.
        <br/>
        3-4. After adding a new layer, I observe that the accuracy plummets to zero and some with accuracy of 100%. The result is that it either 
        perfectly correctly or incorrectly classifies the images. The reason why the final result was NaN% is because adding another FC layer means that
        another layer of linear multiplication is done on the input values. This would mean that there are a total of two linear multiplication layers 
        which lead to a gradient overflow, thus making the resulting value explode. The value increases dramatically to inifinity, leading the final
        value to a NaN%.

      <div class = "container" id = "section4">
        <h3>section 4: problem 3</h3>
        <h4>(section 3 didn't have any writeups)</h4>
        Adding the ReLu layer didn't help with the classification (worsened it). Every classification remained around 10%, and there were a lot of
         inferences that were completely wrong with the classifications. Interestingly all classifications remained at 10% consistently.
         Increasing the number of units of the first FC model to 100 definitely made the classfications a lot better. The accuracies varied with many 
         being correctlyl classified. However, there are plenty of incorrectly classified images with accuracy of less than 10%. It seems like the first
         trial with only the flatten and the FC layer with 10 units gave the best results for the number images. The last trial with ReLu and the 100 units FC layer
         and the first trial (flatten and FC layer) gave the best classifications so far.

        Above are the screenshots of the model's result with 1,2,3,4, and 5 FC layers (in this order)
        The training time increases as the number of layers increase. I observed that it is the best when
        using 3 FC layers. Making the second wide and first narrow performed better than vice versa. This is probably because 
        making the first layer narrow gets the data loss. Yes I see similar results.

        As the BATCH_SIZE went down, the loss value was less stable. The bigger the BATCH_SIZE, the more stable
        the values of loss were. Also, with the value of NUM_BATCHES, when this value increased, the final loss 
        value decreased as this number increased.

      <div class = "container" id = "problem6">

        1. I see that even when the classifications are correct, they are with a very low probability of around 
        10%. When the classification is determined to be incorrect, the probability values are not too far from 
        the correct classification values. 
        2. As expected, when the NUM_BATCHES increased, the overall accuracy of the classifications were better than before. 
        When the BATCH_SIZE increased to 100, the probabilities of the correctly classified images went up to 70%, 
        which was not a probability we could see before.

        After playing with the demo, I found that there are certain characteristics
        that the model looks for when classifying the number. 
        <img src = "img/assignment3/one.jpg" width = "100%">
        Looking at this image, we see that the number drawn is hard to tell, but could
        be easily classified as a 2. However, when I didn't draw the curves on the 
        corners of the numbers, the model classified the drawing as a 1. 
        Like this, we see that if the drawing keeps certain core characteristics of the number,
        the classification follows them. 
      </div>

      <div class = "container" id = "problem2">
        <h3>problem 2</h3>
        1. The lines on the styled image got thicker as the same style was applied to the image 
        numerous times. I took the styled image, fed it into the model, and styled it again. 
        There weren't drastic changes, but I could see the lines thickening like the example below.
        <img src = "img/assignment3/two.jpg" width = "100%"> 

        2. The results were similar to what I had expected. The images had a bit of a different color scheme, 
        but that was expected since the image I was feeding in had a different color range.
        The results are shown below. 
        <img src = "img/assignment3/three.jpg" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment3/four.jpg" width = "100%">

        3. After feeding in a few different images and filters, I realized that when two different
        filters were applied, a lot of the details of the image were gone since a lot of the filters
        average out the image to apply the filter. The below examples show the differences of 
        applying a filter on top of an already filtered image vs. applying the filter directly on the
        original image.
        <img src = "img/assignment3/five.jpg" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment3/six.jpg" width = "100%">
        <img src = "img/assignment3/seven.jpg" width = "100%">

        3. MNIST is much simpler problem than CIFAR-10. Fashion MNIST has similar training times 
        since it is still a type of the MNIST. After searching online for possible reasons why,
        it seems like it would take hours to have a better accuracy with the CIFAR-10. 

        4. Like the problem mentions, there is a point at which adding more layers plateaus or 
        even decreases the maximum accuracy you are able to achieve with that model. Adding more
        convolutional layers will relate to the accuracy and the training speed to a certain level,
        but after the certain point is reached it wouldn't effect them anymore.

        The rewards didn't particularly improve over time in the later terms. The results were still pretty
        inconsistent. However, when we see the very early results, we see that there were
        a lot of results of 0 before the 1.0 reward came in. This shows that there was some improvement
        in the beginning. I guess that it is the learning factor and the discount factor that caused these results.
        The given values for both were pretty big, leading to this results.

        less frequent values of 1.0 happening in comparison to the earlier result with the 
        learning rate of 0.8.
        Then, when I decreased the discount factor to 0.1 with a low learning rate, the result 
        was significantly worsened with very rare results of 1.0 happening in comparison to the 
        earlier results.
